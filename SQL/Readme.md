# Important Notes for SQL ProblemSets

1. For all of the ProblemSets provided, you will create a set of tables, fill them with data, and execute SELECT statements based on them.
1. Read the SetupInstructions.md under each Problemset folders for a description of the sample case and the table structures.
1. The data with which to populate the tables needs to be generated based on the sample data provided in the Tables.pdf or specific *.pdf files that is provided.
   You would need to generated 2 files
   1. TableSetup.sql (Has the DDL Statements for the respective tables)
   1. DataSetup.sql (Has the DML Statements for DataSetup into the respective DB Tables)
   **Note**: Some Problemsets might provide you with the files for datasetup. Make sure you upload a copy of the same under Solutions folder.
1. The list of questions from which to generate your SELECT statements is given in the Questions.md file.
1. You are to translate the english into a SQL query that computes the desired result over all possible databases. 
1. Your queries are expected to be run intially using SQLite, so you must conform to the SQL constructs supported by SQLite.
1. Unless a specific result ordering is asked for, you can return the result rows in any order.
1. Upload your sql solutions as Solutions.sql (One per problemset) file in the format specified under [Samples](https://github.com/krishnakumarraghu/New-Onboards-Training/tree/master/Samples). 
1. This needs to be uploaded into your respective Git folders.
1. You can use SQLFiddle for building your schema and test execution. But you will need to submit your results using a SQLite instance you will create using the steps mentioned in
[SQLite Install](https://github.com/krishnakumarraghu/New-Onboards-Training/blob/master/SQL/SQLliteInsstallation.md)
1. You can create one small sqllite DB and complete all of the problesets by setting up the necessary tables. You will need to upload the sqllite db as well to your respective Solutions folders.
1. Once you complete all of the problemsets , you will need to complete the final [Grading Set](https://github.com/krishnakumarraghu/New-Onboards-Training/blob/master/SQL/GradingSet/README.md) to mark your SQL Assessment as Complete.
