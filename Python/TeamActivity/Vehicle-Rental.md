# Team Activity 01

## Problem Statement 
The problem is to develop an object-oriented design and implementation of a program capable of maintaining reservations for a
vehicle rental agency. The agency rents out three types of vehiclesâ€”cars, vans, and moving trucks. 
The program should allow users to check for available vehicles, request rental charges by vehicle type, 
get the cost of renting a particular type vehicle for a specified period of time, and make/cancel reservations.

## Program Requirements

The General requirements for this program are  
1. Users to be able to check for the availability of vehicles of a certain type (cars, vans, or trucks)
2. Request rental charges by vehicle type
3. Determine the rental cost for a particular vehicle and rental period
4. Make and cancel reservations

The Specific requirements of this program are
1. The Program must maintain a group of specific model vehicles for the following vehicle categories
	   Cars,vans and trucks with the following characteristics:
		Cars: make/model,miles-per-gallon,No.of.Passengers,No.of.Doors,VIN
		Vans: make/model,miles-per-gallon,No.of.Passengers,VIN
		Trucks: miles-per-gallon,length,No.of.Rooms,VIN
2. The Program must be able to display the specific vehicles available for rent by vehicle type.
3. The Program must display the cost associated with a given type vehicle including daily,weekend and weeklyrate,
	   insurance cost,mileage charge,and No. of free Miles.	
4. The Program must also allow the users to determine the cost of the particular vehicle for a given period of time ,
	   an estimated no. of miles and cost of Optional insurance.	   
5. The Program must allow a particular vehicle to be reserved or cancelled.

	
The specific rental costs for each vehicle type are given as
